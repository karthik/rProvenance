* What was the sequence of commands used to create this object?
* When was this object last updated?
* Who created this object and on what type of machine?
* What versions of the different packages were used when computing this object?
* What actual functions and packages were used when creating this object?
  Not just what functions were mentioned in all of the code, but which ones were actually used.
* If we modify variable d, what other variables need to be updated?
* Same for functions, i.e. if we find a bug in a function f, what results become suspect? All of them
  or can we determine which objects were computed using that function, perhaps even a particular expression/"line of code" in the function?

* When we read data from a file, capture the state of that file.
* When we are reading blocks from a connection, we would like to know
  the beginning and end/number of bytes.
* When we read from a URL, etc. we want to capture the time and possibly the header information
  of the response. 
* When we access a URL, we may need a cookie or token.

* How can we handle shell commands and know whether they would change if we ran them again
  Dependencies similar to make, but hard to capture comprehensively
    e.g. count = system("wc -l *.csv", intern = TRUE)
         n = as.integer(gsub("total", "", count))

       If we knew the directory, we could capture its state.
       If we knew the file pattern (*.csv), we could capture their collective state and then determine if it has changed.
