Mechanism to instrument dynamic/run-time capturing
of provenance, i.e. call stack on the returned objects and local variables.

top-level task provenance  - i.e. startProv 
   capture call, timestamp, .Random.seed, 
     reference sessionInfo, pid,  (or keep copy in each object)

Write the provenance to centralized storage
   R environment
   directory
   S3 bucket
   Dropbox folder

[done] Meta data in PNG files
  See my version of Simon U's png package.
   plotPNG in this package that depends on my version of that package for now.
   Add information about how to decode each of the metadata elements.

Query provenance
   See inst/doc/ProvenanceQuestions
     Add more example questions

CodeDepends
  Analyze code statically
  Also use for analysis of expressions issued at run-time, i.e. interactively
  Capture provenance from that
  Visualize script, dependencies, workflow
  Answer queries about flow/provenance
  [Done] Run up to a particular variable - sourceVariable()

  Much of this is conceptually already in CodeDepends, but 
  first thing is to ensure it works
